Context and conventions for building the **Bonté Maison WhatsApp Automation** project.

> **Status legend:**
> ✅ = Implemented / planned in original scope and still valid
> 🟡 = Partially covered, needs expansion
> 🔴 = New scope, not yet implemented
> ⚠️ = Needs client clarification before building

---

## Project overview

WhatsApp automation for **Bonté Maison**, a premium rental property near Duras, France. Owned by Jim. Single property, English-speaking guests.

**Core behavior:** Customer sends WhatsApp → bot parses intent/dates with Claude → checks iCal availability → looks up pricing in Airtable → replies using pre-approved templates in Jim's voice. Bot nudges toward booking, offers 5-day date holds, runs follow-up sequences, and sends short WhatsApp nudges when SuperControl emails are sent.

---

## Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js + Nest.js (monorepo, single app)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Hosting:** Railway
- **Data:**
  - Airtable — pricing, templates, conversations (CRM), holds, message log, follow-up queue
  - iCal feed — availability (fetched fresh per inquiry)
- **External APIs:**
  - WhatsApp Business API (direct, not Twilio)
  - Anthropic Claude API (Haiku 4.5 for parsing)
  - SuperControl — email ingestion (method TBD — IMAP or webhook) ⚠️
- **Testing:** Jest + TDD
- **Jobs:** node-cron for background tasks (hold expiries, follow-ups)

---

## Architecture principles

- **Templates, not LLM-generated replies.** Claude parses. Templates reply. Never let Claude freestyle customer-facing copy.
- **Backend orchestrates, Airtable stores.** No chained Airtable automations.
- **Fail safe toward the human.** Uncertain = holding reply + notify Jim + pause.
- **Premium tone throughout.** Warm, confident, quietly persuasive. Never pushy.
- **Bot nudges toward booking.** After answering questions, conversion hooks ("happy to hold dates for you while you decide?").

## Conventions

### Airtable access
All Airtable ops go through `AirtableService`. Never import Airtable SDK directly in feature modules.

### WhatsApp sending
All outbound messages through `WhatsappService.sendMessage()`. Logs every send, respects pause state, handles retries.

### Logging
Use `LoggerService`, not `console.log`. Every log specifies module tag + level:

```ts
logger.info('whatsapp', 'Received message from +62...');
logger.warn('parser', 'Claude returned unexpected format', { raw });
logger.error('pricing', 'Missing pricing band for date', { date });
```

Colors:
- `whatsapp` → cyan
- `parser` → magenta
- `availability` → blue
- `pricing` → yellow
- `templates` → green
- `conversation` → white
- `holds` → bright yellow
- `follow-ups` → bright blue
- `email-integration` → bright magenta
- `notifications` → bright green
- `booking-rules` → bright cyan
- `knowledge-base` → bright yellow
- `airtable` → gray
- `error` → red (overrides)

### Error handling
- Webhook always returns 200 (WhatsApp retries aggressively on non-200).
- Errors inside processing → log + holding reply + notify Jim.
- No silent failures.

### Tone rules (enforced in templates)
- Use **"reserved"** not "sold" or "taken"
- Warm, premium, human
- Confident but not pushy
- Gently guide toward booking
- Sign off as **Jim**, include **www.bontemaison.com** where appropriate
- Vary sign-offs: "Thanks", "Thank you", "Kind regards", "Many thanks"

## Development approach

### TDD workflow
Write failing test → minimal code → refactor → move on.

### Incremental build order

> Status: original plan covered Phase 0. Phases 1-7 are new scope from Jim's updated requirements.

#### ✅ Phase 0 — Foundation (originally planned, not yet built)
1. Logger service
2. Airtable service (base client)
3. iCal parser + availability check
4. Pricing calculator (basic)
5. Template service
6. Claude parser
7. WhatsApp webhook + sender
8. Conversation state + pause/resume commands
9. Basic orchestration (MessageHandler)

#### 🔴 Phase 1 — Booking rules & enhanced pricing
10. Booking rules module (Sunday changeover, 7-night minimum enforcement, weekly blocks 1-2-3 weeks)
11. Seasonal pricing bands (multi-band schema in Airtable)
12. 2026 fully-booked redirect rule
13. Long-stay detection (Oct-May) → manual pricing flag
14. Discount request detection → flag + notify Jim

#### 🔴 Phase 2 — Hold system
15. Holds table in Airtable
16. "Offer to hold" after quote scenarios
17. Hold acceptance flow
18. Hold expiry cron (daily check)
19. Reminder before expiry (day 4)
20. Auto-release on expiry
21. Bot awareness: if dates held by someone else, treat as unavailable

#### 🔴 Phase 3 — Follow-up sequences
22. Follow-up queue table in Airtable
23. Scheduler: detect enquiries with no reply + no booking
24. 24-hour follow-up send
25. 7-day follow-up send
26. Cancel sequence if customer replies or books

#### 🔴 Phase 4 — CRM expansion
27. Expand Conversations schema (name, email, price_quoted, status enum, follow_up_count, etc.)
28. Every handler updates CRM fields
29. Status transitions: New → Responded → Follow-up → Booked / Lost

#### 🔴 Phase 5 — SuperControl email integration
30. Email ingestion method (IMAP monitoring OR webhook — TBD ⚠️)
31. Email parser (identify type: booking confirmation / arrival / pre-arrival / mid-stay / thank you / review)
32. Guest matcher (match email recipient → WhatsApp conversation)
33. Nudge trigger logic + dedup
34. "Do not send if guest cannot be confidently matched" rule

#### 🔴 Phase 6 — Notifications to Jim
35. Notification channel setup (WhatsApp to Jim's number — assuming this by default)
36. Wire escalation triggers: uncertain, outside KB, discount, long stay, hold conflicts, unmatched guest

#### 🔴 Phase 7 — Instant book toggle
37. Config flag `INSTANT_BOOK_ENABLED`
38. Swap `booking_confirmed_handoff` variant based on flag
39. When Jim flips the switch post-SuperControl setup: bot redirects to website

---

### Testing rules
- Mock all external services in unit tests
- `*.spec.ts` colocated with source
- Test edge cases: empty iCal, missing pricing band, Claude malformed JSON, WhatsApp API 429, expired holds on boot, duplicate email events
- No integration tests against real APIs in CI

---

## Airtable schema

### `Pricing`
- `season_name` (string)
- `start_date` (date)
- `end_date` (date)
- `weekly_rate` (currency)
- `notes` (text)

### `Templates`
- `key` (string, e.g. `availability_yes_quote`)
- `variant` (number)
- `text` (long text, with `{placeholders}`)
- `active` (checkbox)

### `Conversations` (CRM)
- `phone` (string, primary)
- `guest_name` (string)
- `email` (string)
- `status` (enum: `New | Responded | Follow-up | Booked | Lost`)
- `pause_status` (enum: `bot | human | paused`)
- `pause_until` (datetime)
- `dates_requested` (string — most recent)
- `price_quoted` (currency — most recent)
- `availability_result` (string — most recent)
- `last_intent` (string)
- `last_activity` (datetime)
- `follow_up_count` (number)
- `follow_up_24h_sent` (checkbox)
- `follow_up_7d_sent` (checkbox)
- `enquiry_source` (string)
- `notes` (long text — Jim's manual notes)

### `Holds` 🔴
- `phone` (string, linked to Conversations)
- `check_in` (date)
- `check_out` (date)
- `hold_created_at` (datetime)
- `hold_expires_at` (datetime — hold_created_at + 5 days)
- `reminder_sent` (checkbox)
- `status` (enum: `active | expired | converted | cancelled`)

### `KnowledgeBase`
Property-fact FAQs. Bot answers directly (no handoff) when parser classifies `general_info` into one of these `topic_key`s with confidence ≥ 0.7.
- `topic_key` (string, e.g. `pool_heated`, `sleeps`, `location`)
- `question_examples` (long text — comma-separated phrasings for parser prompt)
- `answer` (long text, supports `{name}` placeholder)
- `active` (checkbox)

### `MessageLog`
- `phone`
- `direction` (`in | out`)
- `text`
- `intent` (parsed, if direction=in)
- `template_key` (if direction=out)
- `timestamp`

### `BookingRules` 🔴
Simple key-value config for rules that change:
- `key` (e.g. `year_2026_fully_booked`)
- `value`
- `active`

## Claude parser output (reference)

Claude classifies intent and extracts entities per incoming message. Expected JSON output:

```json
{
  "intent": "availability_inquiry | pricing_inquiry | greeting | general_info | booking_confirmation | hold_request | discount_request | human_request | complaint_or_frustration | off_topic_or_unclear",
  "check_in_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
  "check_out_date": "YYYY-MM-DD | null",
  "nights": "number | null",
  "guest_count": "number | null",
  "guest_name": "string | null",
  "guest_email": "string | null",
  "mentions_dogs": "boolean",
  "mentions_discount": "boolean",
  "high_intent_signal": "boolean",
  "confidence": "high | low",
  "notes": "string — disambiguation context"
}
```

`high_intent_signal` = true when message suggests booking readiness ("this looks great", multiple questions, "we'd like to come", etc.) → triggers hold offer in reply.

---

## Booking rules (validation logic)

Enforced in `booking-rules/` module before pricing/availability:

1. **Check-in must be Sunday.** If not → suggest nearest Sunday.
2. **Check-out must be Sunday.** Duration in multiples of 7 (1, 2, or 3 weeks).
3. **Minimum 7 nights.** Fewer → offer 7-night alternative.
4. **2026 dates → redirect to 2027.** (Use iCal to suggest actual 2027 availability.)
5. **Oct–May + long stay (>3 weeks or monthly):** flag manual pricing, do not auto-quote.
6. **Stay spans two pricing bands:** use the band containing the check-in date. ⚠️ *Assumed, needs client confirmation.*

---

## What NOT to do

- **No LLM-generated customer replies.** Ever.
- **No chained Airtable automations.**
- **No in-memory state.** Railway restarts will wipe it.
- **No skipping tests.**
- **No `console.log`.** Use LoggerService.
- **No bypassing AirtableService / WhatsappService.**
- **No proactive discount offers.** Bot never suggests a discount.
- **No alternative-date suggestions when unavailable.** Jim handles those.
- **No sending WhatsApp to unmatched guests** in SuperControl integration.
- **No overengineering.** Bare minimum first.

---

## Out of scope (confirmed)

- Multiple properties
- Taking payments
- Non-English languages
- Complaint resolution (hand off only)
- Admin dashboard / UI
- Compound responses (multi-intent stitching)
- 48-hour follow-up (explicitly removed by client)

---

## Open questions ⚠️

1. **SuperControl integration method** — IMAP monitoring or webhook?
2. **Pricing band edge case** — stay spanning two bands: which rate? (Assumed: check-in date's band.)
3. **Long stay threshold** — strictly monthly (1-6 months) or any stay >3 weeks in Oct-May?
4. **Jim's notification channel** — assumed WhatsApp to his personal number. Confirm?
5. **Hold vs. real booking conflict** — assumed bot says "unavailable" to a second enquirer when dates are held by another. Confirm?
