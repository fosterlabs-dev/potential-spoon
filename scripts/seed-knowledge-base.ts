  {
    topic_key: 'pool_overview',
    question_examples: 'is there a pool, do you have a pool, swimming pool, what about the pool, pool size',
    answer: `Yes — there's a lovely outdoor pool at the house, set in a beautiful spot overlooking the countryside.\n\nIt's one of the favourite features of Bonté Maison, especially over the long summer days. Guests tend to spend a lot of the day in and around it.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'pool_heated',
    question_examples: 'is the pool heated, pool temperature, warm pool',
    answer: `The pool isn't heated, but it's warmed naturally by the sun and from around June through September it sits at a really lovely temperature.\n\nThere are also two hot tubs at the house, which are lovely for relaxing in the evenings whatever the season.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'outdoor_area',
    question_examples: 'outdoor area, garden, terrace, outside, outdoor space, BBQ, grounds',
    answer: `There's a wonderful outdoor area to enjoy — a terrace for meals, plenty of space to relax, and lovely views over the surrounding countryside and vineyards.\n\nIn the warmer months it's where most of the day naturally spends itself: long lunches outside, evenings on the terrace, and quiet time around the pool.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'sleeps',
    question_examples: 'how many people, how many guests, how many bedrooms, capacity',
    answer: `The house comfortably sleeps 10 across five bedrooms.\n\nWe can also accommodate an 11th guest if it's a child, using a good quality fold-out bed that's already at the house.\n\nThere are also two cots available if needed, so it works really well for families or mixed groups.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'car_needed',
    question_examples: 'do we need a car, is a car required, can we get around without a car',
    answer: `Yes, I would definitely recommend having a car.\n\nThe house is in a lovely, peaceful setting surrounded by countryside and vineyards, which is part of what makes it so special, but it does mean you'll want a car to explore properly.\n\nThere are some fantastic local towns, markets and restaurants nearby, all within a short drive.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'ev_charger',
    question_examples: 'EV charger, electric car charging, Tesla, electric vehicle',
    answer: `There isn't an EV charger at the house itself.\n\nHowever, there are charging points available locally in the nearby towns, so it's still very manageable if you're travelling with an electric car. The nearest is at 80 Avenue de la Résistance, 33220 Pineuilh (about 10 minutes' drive).`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'pool_towels',
    question_examples: 'pool towels, towels provided, do we need to bring towels',
    answer: `Yes — all towels are provided, including pool towels.\n\nEverything is set up so you can arrive and settle in straight away.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'nearest_shops',
    question_examples: 'nearest shops, supermarket, groceries, where to shop',
    answer: `The nearest shops are just a short drive away in the local towns. You've got everything you need nearby — bakeries, supermarkets, and some really good local markets, especially in the summer months.\n\nMost guests tend to pick things up on the way in, then top up locally during the week.\n\nHere are the recommendations:\n- E.Leclerc Pineuilh — 80 Avenue de la Résistance, 33220 Pineuilh (huge hypermarket)\n- Carrefour Contact — 83 Chemin Boutères Pourraou, 47120 Duras`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'cot_highchair',
    question_examples: 'cot, highchair, baby equipment, travelling with a baby',
    answer: `Yes — there are two cots and two highchairs at the house.\n\nIt's very well set up for families, so you shouldn't need to bring those with you.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'dogs',
    question_examples: 'dogs allowed, pet friendly, can we bring our dog',
    answer: `Yes — dogs are very welcome, no limit.\n\nThe house works really nicely for them — plenty of outdoor space and walks nearby.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'check_in_out_times',
    question_examples: 'check-in time, check-out time, arrival time, when can we arrive',
    answer: `Check-in is from 4pm on Sunday, and check-out is by 10am the following Sunday.\n\nThat timing allows us to get everything perfectly prepared for your arrival. Most guests arrive mid to late afternoon and settle straight into the evening.\n\nIf you're running ahead of schedule, it's well worth stopping off at St Emilion if driving from Bordeaux — a fabulous UNESCO world heritage town where wine has been produced for centuries. Closer to Bonté, Sainte-Foy and Duras are both lovely for a coffee on the terraces.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'location',
    question_examples: 'where is the property, location, nearest airport, how to get there',
    answer: `Bonté Maison is near Duras in south-west France — between Bordeaux and Bergerac, right in the middle of wine country.\n\nIt's a quiet, private spot surrounded by vineyards, with some fantastic medieval towns nearby: Eymet, Duras and Bergerac are all close. It's a great base for exploring the Dordogne.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'how_to_book',
    question_examples: 'how do I book, how can I book, how to reserve, booking process, how do I confirm, how to pay',
    answer: `The easiest way is to book directly online at www.bontemaison.com — just select Booking from the menu and the system will guide you through everything, including the 25% deposit to secure your dates.\n\nThe balance is due 8 weeks before arrival.

  },
  {
    topic_key: 'deposit',
    question_examples: 'deposit, how much deposit, what is the deposit, deposit needed, deposit amount, payment terms, booking terms',
    answer: `A 25% deposit secures your dates, with the remaining balance due 8 weeks before arrival.\n\nWe also take a £200 refundable security deposit, which is returned after your stay. Payments can be made in £ or €, all major cards accepted.\n\nIf you let me know the week you'd like, I can confirm the exact deposit amount and either send the booking details through or point you to the online booking at www.bontemaison.com.`,

  {
    topic_key: 'property_overview',
    question_examples: 'tell me about the villa, tell me about the property, what is the house like, what is the villa, describe the property, can you tell me about, more info about the house',
    answer: `Bonté is a private luxury villa in the Dordogne, set in peaceful countryside close to Duras, Eymet and Bergerac, and well placed for the Bordeaux wine region.\n\nIt sleeps 10 across five bedrooms (two king-size and three twin), making it ideal for families, friends and multi-generational stays. We can also accommodate an 11th guest if it's a child, using a good quality fold-out bed.\n\nThe house is reserved exclusively for your group and includes the private pool, two hot tubs, generous outdoor dining space, a BBQ, pétanque court, fast WiFi, bedding, towels, pool towels, cleaning and a welcome pack on arrival.`,

    answer: `Yes, the area around Bonté is excellent for cycling, with quiet country roads and vineyard routes around Duras and Eymet.\n\nLocal companies can arrange bike hire and in many cases either deliver to the house or meet guests nearby. If cycling is something you'd like to build into your stay, I'd be very happy to point you towards suitable local options before you arrive.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'local_area',
    question_examples: 'what is the local area like, what is there to do, things to do, nearby, what is around, area, surroundings, restaurants, eating out, where to eat',
    answer: `There's so much to enjoy in the local area. The medieval towns of Eymet, Duras and Bergerac are all close by, and the wider Dordogne is a wonderful region to explore.\n\nDuras is around 10 minutes away and the Château des Vigiers is close by for a more traditional setting, including relaxed dining on the terrace. Eymet and Bergerac are excellent for evenings out with market squares, wine bars and highly rated French restaurants. In July and August, booking ahead is sensible.\n\nVineyards, local markets, restaurants and wine experiences are all easily within reach. You can also see our eating-out guide at www.bontemaison.com/eating-out.`,
  },
  {
    topic_key: 'air_conditioning',
    question_examples: 'air conditioning, AC, A/C, is there air con, do you have air conditioning, is it hot inside',
    answer: `There isn't air conditioning at Bonté. The house is a traditional French property with thick stone walls and shutters, which keep it comfortably cool during the warmer months when guests use the shutters during the day and open up in the evenings. There are also fans in the bedrooms.\n\nMost of the summer is naturally spent outside by the pool, on the terrace or in the evening shade.`,
