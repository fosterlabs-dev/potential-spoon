/**
 * Per-row expectations for the feedback regression script.
 *
 * Each row corresponds to a customer message in `.claude/feedbacks/feedback-1.csv`,
 * matched by exact text. For each, we list:
 *   - mustInclude:    regexes the bot reply MUST match (premium-tone signals,
 *                     correct facts, expected next steps)
 *   - mustNotInclude: regexes the bot reply MUST NOT match (known bugs from the
 *                     audited reply column)
 *   - notes:          short human-readable rationale linking back to the
 *                     "Rule Application / Agent Logic" column from the CSV
 *
 * Keep regexes pragmatic, not poetic — a passing reply is one free of the
 * concrete defects we already identified, not one that perfectly matches the
 * recommended copy.
